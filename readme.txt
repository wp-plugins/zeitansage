== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= What is the purpose of this plugin? =
It displays the time as verbal expression. That's all. No deeper meaning.

= I refreshed the browser but nothing changes, what's wrong? =
Most probably nothing at all. The current time is rounded to a 5-minute precision, so it will display a new text only every 5 minutes.

= Does it do anything else? =
No, really, it's very simple.

= Will other languages be supported? =
English will definitely be supported in the next version. As for other languages, I doubt that I will be able to do it, but if you'd like to contribute, feel free to contact me.
