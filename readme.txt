== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= What is the purpose of this plugin? =
It displays the time as verbal expression. That's all. No deeper meaning.

= I refreshed the browser but nothing changes, what's wrong? =
Most probably nothing at all. The current time is rounded to a 5-minute precision, so it will display a new text only every 5 minutes.

= Does it do anything else? =
No, really, it's very simple.

= Will other languages be supported? =
Feel free to contribute translations for other languages. However, it might be necessary to adjust the plugin code as well, as time expressions are 
built in various ways in different languages.
